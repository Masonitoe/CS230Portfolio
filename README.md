# CS230Portfolio
1. In the gaming room, the client asked to devleop a cloud based aplication where the users are able to access the game on any platform.
2. While developing the applicaiton, I was honored to gain the knowledge of understanind how inheretance worked. I never fully understood what inheretance was or what it did until I took this course.
3. WHen working through a design document, it helped me understand what needed to be done before I did it. I used the document as an outline of what features are needed to better understand what code had to be written.
4. If I was able to learn more about somethign it would be the UML diagrams. I don't fully understand them yet and wish we spent a lot more time doing them. 
5. When looking at user needs, we make sure to implement what the user wants in an application because it helps increase user experience. When we do so the applicaiton becomes more and more user friendly.
6. When designing an applicaiton, I will always outline my work before getting started. When making things suhc as a UML diagram and then outlining the functionality of my code, I will be able to better stay on track and complete my vision. Not being organized may result in loss of time or other issues.
